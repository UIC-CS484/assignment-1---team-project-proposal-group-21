Topic: Chicago pubc safety info 

My workflow would be to have two branches one to be used as a development Channel and the master/orgin beanch to be used as the ve production version.


For development I would be using the following resources:

- The Chicago Data Portal 
- Googles Charting library  
- W3Schools for various html and css related questions  


This project is being completed individualy.
